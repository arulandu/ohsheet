You are now given the data corresponding to the header/informative regions that you outputted in your previous response.
The ranges are newline separated. For each range, you are given the range, a space, and a comma separated list of backtick-quoted cell values in row-major order where e.g. A1:A3 [`value1`, , `value2`] implies that the second cell is empty. 

Using this information and the previous attribute region information, your task is to detect every table present in the spreadsheet.
You should output a semicolon-separated list of tables. For each table, you should give a comma-separated, parenthesized tuple of three ranges: the data range, the row header range, and the column header range. If either of these headers are blank, you should leave it blank in the tuple: e.g. (A2:D7, A2:D2, ) specifies a blank column header. 

DO NOT ADD OTHER WORDS OR EXPLANATION.
